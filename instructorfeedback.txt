Excellent work! Great job applying methods beyond what was discussed in class.

* Well-written report. Abstract nicely summarizes the problem, methods, and results.

* Background and the need clearly established. Methods & Results described well. A table comparing the performance metrics for the methods you tried would have been nice.

* Code clean and well-organized.

* You should normalize your data before applying TSNE.
